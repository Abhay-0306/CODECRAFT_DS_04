**📌Twitter Sentiment Analysis**
**Organization**: CodeCraft
**Role**: Data Science Intern
**Internship Duration**: 14June2025 - 14July2025

**🧠Project Overview**
During my internship as a Data Science Intern at CodeCraft, I undertook a comprehensive project on Twitter Sentiment Analysis that focused on capturing and understanding public sentiment in real time based on specific keywords, brands, or hashtags. The core objective of the project was to analyze tweets and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. This involved collecting live Twitter data using the Tweepy API, followed by extensive preprocessing of the tweet text—cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing—to prepare it for analysis. A Naive Bayes classifier was then trained and applied to perform sentiment classification with a focus on accuracy and relevance. Additionally, the project included the visualization of sentiment distribution across different topics and tracking shifts in public opinion over time. By identifying influential keywords and analyzing sentiment trends linked to events or campaigns, the project provided valuable, data-driven insights that could inform brand strategies, marketing efforts, and public engagement initiatives.
